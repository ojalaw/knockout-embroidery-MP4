- Some users felt that the collapsible navbar needed titles instead of just icons.
- Some users felt that the stars on the review page needed a background colour to enhance colour contrast.

I used the following break points for responsiveness.  

- 500px  
- 768px  
- 992px
- 1090px
- 1264px
- 1492px

Generic bootstrap breakpoints were also used throughout the site.  

## Bug Reporting
Throughout the development phase of the site, I came across a variety of different bugs/errors that eventually overcame.  

**resolved**  
-	static files temporary fix followed by permanent fix, I added disable static to config vars. However, the introduction of AWS S3 bucket was more of a permanent solution.  
-	import issue with home.views
-	Allowed hosts added for local testing
-	Css folder not registering causing console error
-	404 error when logging user in
-	Application error when logging in user/superuser, hadnâ€™t migrate local database.
-	Heroku migrations error
