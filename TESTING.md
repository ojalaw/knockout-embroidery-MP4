## Automated Testing   

**Sanity Testing**   

**Feature Testing**    

**Endpoint Testing**  

 

## Manual Testing  

During the manual testing, I tested the sites functionality, usability and responsiveness.  

I have kept the basic functionality of the site the same throughout the entire project. Initially leaning towards a note/review site, moving towards a social media site that allows users to create, edit and delete posts.  


#### Functionality

**Home**


 - The feature works as expected. 

**Profile** 


 - The feature works as expected.  

**Products**

 - The feature works as expected.  


**Reviews**

**Usability**  


**Responsiveness**  

I used the following break points for responsiveness.  

- 450px  
- 768px  
- 992px  
- 1200px

Generic bootstrap breakpoints were also used sporadically throughout the site.  

## Bug Reporting
